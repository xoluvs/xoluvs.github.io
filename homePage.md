Welcome to my portfolio.

As an Instructional Designer I have a passion in creating new and engaging solutions to training needs. From a quick 2â€“5-minute job aid, through a fully functional simulation, I find it exciting to measure the results of my work and see the impact I am making.

My skills include a variety of tools and coding that includes, Adobe Creative Suite, Articulate 360 and Storyline, Camtasia, Figma, JavaScripting, Learning Management System (LMS) administration, Vyond, and many others.  I thrive on teaching myself new skills and building new interactions that increase fun and learner engagement. 
 
My background includes experience working with emergency response agencies, customer service, technical training and troubleshooting, end user technology support, and many others.

I appreciate the time youâ€™re taking to look at my portfolio.
